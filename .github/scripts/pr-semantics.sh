# The PR semantics gate: the contract every pull request into main is held
# to, so that what its squash merge leaves on main tells the truth about the
# release it makes:
#
#   1. The PR title is a Conventional Commit header: the squash merge gives
#      main a commit with that header, and a release is versioned and its
#      changelog written from main's commits.
#   2. Every commit in the PR is a Conventional Commit (merge commits are
#      exempt; fixup!/squash! commits must be autosquashed before merging).
#   3. The title's release impact EQUALS the highest release impact of the
#      commits: the title may neither understate the release (a fix: title
#      over a feat: commit) nor promise one the commits do not make (a feat:
#      title over docs-only commits). The squash commit's body keeps the
#      commits' messages, BREAKING CHANGE footers included.
#
# Impact classes, as semantic versioning reads Conventional Commits:
#   major = "!" after the type/scope, or a "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer
#   minor = feat
#   patch = fix, revert
#   none  = docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore
# (a perf or refactor that must ship a release is a fix).
#
# Environment:
#   REPO       owner/name of the repository
#   PR_NUMBER  the pull request's number
#   PR_TITLE   its title, passed as an environment variable and never
#              interpolated into the script; read from the PR when empty
#   GH_TOKEN   a token able to read the pull request

The contract (CONTRIBUTING.md, "Pull requests"):
  · title and every commit:  <type>[(scope)][!]: <subject>
    types: feat fix docs style refactor perf test build ci chore revert
  · release impact of the title == highest release impact of the commits
    major = "!" or a "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer · minor = feat · patch = fix, revert · none = the rest
  · merge commits are exempt; autosquash fixup!/squash! before merging
